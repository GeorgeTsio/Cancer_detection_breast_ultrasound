# Cancer_detection_breast_ultrasound

I am going to use the breast ultrasound images dataset from kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset], to effectively classify images into normal, benign or malignant. I'm using the ResNet34 architecture for my model. Also, you can find to more custom images, to test this model.
